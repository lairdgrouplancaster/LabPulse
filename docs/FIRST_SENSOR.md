# Connect your first sensor

[Installation](INSTALLATION.md) → [Dashboard walkthrough](DASHBOARD_WALKTHROUGH.md) → **First sensor** → [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md)

This walkthrough connects one Arduino pressure reading to LabPulse. You'll
identify the board, give LabPulse a small configuration, and check the result
on the dashboard. It follows the [Dashboard walkthrough](DASHBOARD_WALKTHROUGH.md),
where you explored readings and alarms using simulated data.

Adding support for a different sensor to the open-source project? Follow
[Contributing sensors](../CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-sensors) for the firmware,
driver, testing, and GitHub pull-request steps.

You need a Pi with LabPulse installed and an Arduino with a working, correctly
wired pressure sensor. This is the software setup, not a pressure-sensor wiring
guide. Check [the hardware guide](HARDWARE.md) and your sensor's documentation
before connecting it.

Use a new or dedicated practice installation. The example below replaces its
configuration with one service. Don't paste it over an existing lab's settings;
for an existing installation, make a backup and add the service to its existing
`services` section instead. Add the setup under `setups` too, or use the ID of
one you've already defined. Keep existing IDs unique.

## 1. Check what the Arduino sends

**On the computer connected to the Arduino**, install the
[LabPulse firmware library](../firmware/README.md#install-the-library) and
choose the example that matches your hardware. The `pressure_monitor` example
includes pressure, temperature, and humidity. Its pressure conversion assumes
a particular calibration; check [those assumptions](../firmware/README.md#pressure-monitor)
against your actual sensor before using it.

After uploading, open the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor at **9600 baud**. A
usable pressure field looks like this:

```text
pressure: 1.20 | temperature: 20.10 | humidity: 45.0
```

Those numbers are illustrative. Your values should match what the sensors
measure. `pressure: null` means there isn't a usable pressure value; fix that
before going on. The label `pressure` is what LabPulse will match, and the
firmware's pressure value must be in **bar** for this example.

Close Serial Monitor when you've checked the output. Only one program should
use the serial port at a time. Connect the Arduino to the Pi with a USB data
cable if it isn't already connected there.

## 2. Find the board on the Pi

**In the Pi's terminal**, run:

```bash
ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/
```

Find the entry for your Arduino and copy its full path, starting with
`/dev/serial/by-id/`. With several boards connected, use
[Assigning serial devices](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#assigning-serial-devices) to check
which is which. If the directory is missing, check the USB data cable and that
the Pi recognises the board before continuing.

Use this persistent path rather than `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`, whose
number can change when devices are reconnected.

For example, a listing might contain `usb-Arduino_Example-if00 -> ../../ttyACM0`.
The path to copy would be `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Arduino_Example-if00`, not
`../../ttyACM0`. This name is illustrative; use the one printed for your board.

## 3. Describe one reading

Run `labpulse config` **on the Pi**, then select `config.yaml`. On a new practice
installation, replace its contents with the
[complete one-sensor example](examples/minimal-serial.yaml):

```yaml
timezone: Europe/London
mqtt:
  broker: mosquitto
sms:
  dry_run: true
setups:
  compressed_air:
    label: Compressed Air
services:
  pressure_monitor:
    label: Pressure Monitor
    driver:
      type: labpulse.serial_pipe
      options:
        port: /dev/serial/by-id/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_BOARD
        baud_rate: 9600
    measurements:
      pressure:
        label: Pressure
        setups: [compressed_air]
        unit: bar
        device_class: pressure
        show_graph: true
```

Replace the port with the path from step 2 and set your timezone. The port above
is a placeholder, not a device that exists. For help with spacing and editing,
see [YAML basics](CONFIGURATION.md#a-few-yaml-basics).

The example asks LabPulse to read one Arduino through `labpulse.serial_pipe`,
take the field named `pressure`, and show it in the **Compressed Air** setup.
The other serial fields are ignored because this configuration doesn't request
them. `unit: bar` labels the value; it doesn't convert a reading from another
unit. `show_graph: true` adds a graph to the dashboard.

Save and close the editor. LabPulse checks the configuration before applying
it. If it reports a file and field with an error, correct those and try again.
Keep `sms.dry_run: true` while testing.

## 4. Start reading real hardware

If you've been using simulation, saving the configuration keeps simulation
enabled. To switch to the Arduino, run **on the Pi**:

```bash
labpulse down
labpulse setup
labpulse up
labpulse ps
labpulse doctor
```

If the installation was already using real hardware, saving a changed
configuration can start its workers immediately. You can check them with
`labpulse ps` and `labpulse doctor`.

In Home Assistant, keep **Test mode** and **Mute all notifications** on. Open
**System Status**: **Pressure Monitor** should say **Working**, with a current
pressure reading. Open **Monitor** to find it under **Compressed Air**.

If it doesn't appear, inspect the service's logs:

```bash
labpulse logs --tail 100 labpulse-pressure-monitor
```

Check the port, baud rate, and `pressure` field name before changing alarm
settings. [Serial troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#serial-readings-are-missing-or-stale) covers missing devices
and stale readings.

## 5. Check the reading, then set an alarm

Compare the displayed pressure with a suitable reference instrument. Seeing
**Working** proves that data is arriving; it doesn't prove the calibration.
If the units or values don't agree, fix the firmware conversion or configuration
before using alarms.

With this practice board, unplug its USB connection and watch **System Status**.
After LabPulse detects the loss, the service should stop showing **Working**.
Reconnect it and check that fresh readings return. Detection and recovery have
delays, so don't expect every dashboard state to change instantly.

Open **Alarm Setup**, select **Configure** beside **Compressed Air**, then
**Configure** beside pressure. Set the mode, limits, and timing for your actual system using
[Configuring alarms](USER_GUIDE.md#configuring-alarms). Test a suitable condition
and recovery before enabling notifications. The practice limits from the
simulation guide are not operating limits for your equipment.

When the reading and alarms behave as expected, save a backup:

```bash
labpulse backup ~/labpulse-first-sensor.tar.gz
```

Use a new filename if that backup already exists. Follow
[Testing SMS](USER_GUIDE.md#testing-sms) separately if you want real text messages.

Keep a short record with the board: its sensor model, firmware revision, USB
path, measurement unit, and the reference reading used to check it. You now
have one identified sensor producing a checked reading; those notes make it
possible for someone else to replace or troubleshoot it later.

## Next: configure your installation

Continue to [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md), the final step in the first-time
path. It builds on the service and measurement you just added, explaining how
to add more readings, group them into setups, and choose how they appear on
the dashboard. Start with the YAML basics and small example, then use the
settings sections as you need them.
